Key points:

* This is initial implementation implementation of the multi-user hybrid mobile application for sharing images (like Pinterest for example)
* There is a lot of refactoring needed in the code
* The application should be considered as a MVP (or POC) that shows how Ionic can be used together with Firebase and Capacitor

Important:

* To connect the Firebase to the application, both environment.ts and environment.prod.ts files must be updated with relevant info like api keys
